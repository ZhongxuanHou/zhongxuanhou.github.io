I've moved over to Arch Linux. A really short review follows:

Its awesome. Installation was easy and for configuring the system for audio, video etc, the Beginners' Guide in the Arch Wiki is sufficient. It makes setting up an Arch system a breeze.

I've set up my archbox with KDEMod4 and I shoud say KDEMod 4.3.2 rocks!! Its stable and zippy especially when you use it in conjuction with Compiz Fusion.

Another thing I liked in Arch was the BSD-style init scripts. All my system's settings are stored in one file - in `/etc/rc.conf`. And that's awesome.

I've saved the best for the last. Pacman. Yes, Pacman is the best thing that has ever happened to my system. It is zippy, it is easy and it keeps rolling. That means all the latest and greatest software is available without doing any reinstallation, which I could not have on Ubuntu and others.

Well, that's it for now. Till then keep rollin' and rockin'.
