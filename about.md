<p>Hello World! I am <span class="emphasize">Sayak Biswas</span>. I am a graduate student at the University of Florida pursuing Masters in the field of Computer Science. Previouly, I used to work for Tata Consultancy Services as an IT Analyst on various web and mobile application development projects. I have an interest in Virtual Reality and AI. I believe that Virtual Reality, together with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are about to change the world as we know it!</p>

<p>I am from a nice little town in India called <span class="emphasize">Siliguri</span>. These days, I stay in Gainesville. I really like coding, reading novels, playing computer games and listening to music. I generally like reading thriller and science fiction novels. That being said, one of my favorite books is <span class="emphasize">Steve Jobs</span> by Walter Isaacson. I love playing RPGs and I think the <span class="emphasize">Mass Effect series</span> is the second greatest entertainment trilogy ever created(first being The Dark Knight trilogy by Chris Nolan). I even loved ME3's ending, so there you go! When it comes to music, I would call myself a music junkie. I go to sleep and wake up with the earphones jacked in. I am really into rock 'n roll. My favorite bands are <span class="emphasize">U2</span>, Muse, Linkin Park, 30 Seconds to Mars in that order. Seeing U2 perform live has been a long time dream of mine.</p>
